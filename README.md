# Get Commits From Another Git Platform

This project was developed to retrieve your commits from another Git platform like GitLab and add them to GitHub. The main idea is to populate our GitHub if you don't usually work with it, like myselfâ€”I'm using GitLab at work.

At this moment, we need to implement some methods to retrieve your commits from another platform. However, if you wish to use it, you only need to 
modify the for loop to specify the number of commits you want to add.

### How to use

1. Clone this reposity
2. Install all dependencies `npm install or yarn install`
3. Create a .env archive to set your Github key, like `GITHUB_KEY="your key here"`
4. Run index.js and be happy!
